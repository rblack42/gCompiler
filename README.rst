This project is a test bed for a simple recursive-descent compiler beginning
C++ students can use to learn how to define and process a baby language. I use
the cod ein this project as the basis for projects in my *COSC2325 - Computer
Architecture and Machine Language* classes at Austin Community College.

An example language, based on C, is used in this example compiler. The compiled
code is run in a simple virtual machine, patterned after one published by
Niklaus Wirth. The actual machine language used is a subse of standard Intel
Pentium assembly language.
